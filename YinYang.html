                <b>Game Description：</b><br>This is a 3D platform puzzle game. The core gameplay of the game is built around the principle that Yin and Yang are compatible with the opposite attributes and repulsive with the same attributes. Players can interact with different Yin and Yang objects in the scene by switching their own Yin and Yang attributes to engage in certain puzzles and battles.

                Objects whose materials have a certain degree of transparency are objects that can be passed through.
                The gray brick material and the white glowing material indicate neutral (Yin and Yang harmony) objects.

            <p style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px">
                To let players learn to use the ability to switch between yin and yang, while having basic knowledge of the level mechanics of yin and yang being compatible and same nature being repulsive. And it provides a lower threshold for players to get started and enter the level flow more easily.
            </p>
            <ol style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Method:</b>
                <li><b>To give players a lower threshold</b>, in this level, only a simple platform jumping mechanism and yin-yang switching mechanism are introduced. The puzzle just requires players to simply remember the order of their jumping platforms.</li>
                <li><b>In order to provide players with an initial understanding of the yin/yang compatible/repulsive mechanism,</b>in the level 1 layout, the red yang platform is placed behind the neutral platform near the yin platform marked with the number 5.The player is in the yin state and will fall directly from the red platform as they walk straight towards it. Players who have just seen the "Yin-Yang is compatible" hint on the platform may feel confused and try to relate the hint to the falling experience. This is the initial stage for players to understand the compatibility of yin and yang.</li>
                <li><b>In order to motivate players to switch between yin and yang states and to further understand the mechanism of yin and yang compatibility/repulsion, </b>spikes with yin and yang attributes were designed and introduced into the first level. After the player falls from the red platform, the player can directly see the yin and yang switch ball and text prompts in front of the player. If the player ignores the hints and switch props and walks straight to the spikes, the character will die directly. In order to pass the spikes, the player will have the motivation to use the yin and yang switching mechanism. After using the Yin-Yang switching mechanism to pass the spikes with opposite attributes, the player will have a better understanding of the mechanism of Yin-Yang compatibility and repulsion. Thus, the player will learn the ability to switch between yin and yang.
                </li>
                <li>The first level of the puzzle challenge is mainly used to adjust the player's interest curve and is relatively easy. At the high platform, there is text that prompts players to turn back and pay attention to their jump path. The text hints at the puzzle make the player associate the puzzle with the previous path hints to solve the puzzle.
                    <b>The simpler puzzle challenges also make it easy for players to gain a sense of accomplishment and enter a positive feedback loop in the early stages.</b>Thus, players are motivated to explore the following game content.</li>
                <li><b>To give the player a clear visual indication, a cut scene of the portal is played after the puzzle is successfully solved.</b></li>

                Enrich the mechanics content and introduce battle-oriented level mechanics to increase the difficulty of the game and bring players a sense of surprise, challenge, and achievement. The mechanics of attracting and firing energy blocks are introduced and made available to players to learn in the process of level 2.

            <ol style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Method:</b>
                <li><b>To enrich the content of the mechanism, and the introduction of combat-oriented level mechanism.</b>A reference to the mechanism of attracting and launching objects in the game <i>Control</i> was made.<b>To conform to the overall setting of yin and yang compatibility and repulsion,</b>The energy block is set to be an object with yin and yang attributes as well, and can only be attracted when it is different from the player's attributes, and launched outward when it is the same as the player's attributes (the launching is a reference to the same-pole repulsion of magnets).</li>
                <li><b>In order to gradually increase the difficulty and avoid giving players frustration too early.</b>The starting cannon trigger area is divided into three separate areas, each time the player enters an area only one cannon trigger, less difficult to dodge and less likely to die. After the player learns the mechanism of destroying cannons , the trigger area becomes a whole. After the player enters the five cannons trigger area, five cannons will shoot at the player together (there is an interval time for firing, giving the player room to operate). In this way, the step-up in difficulty is completed.</li>
                <li><b>In order to conform to the setting of yin and yang compatibility and same repulsion, and to give players a deeper understanding of the mechanics surrounding this setting, the cannonball from the cannon also has yin and yang attributes.</b>No damage to the player when the attributes are different, and damage to the player when the attributes are the same.</li>
                <li><b>In order to allow players to understand the mechanism of same poles repulsion of energy blocks through trial and error,</b>at the prompt to destroy the cannon, two types of energy blocks are placed, and players can understand the same poles repulsion mechanism of energy blocks by attracting different energy blocks and firing them at the cannon.</li>
                <li><b>To give players a sense of surprise and to make better use of the attraction and launch mechanism.</b>Here the final puzzle design is associated with the Bagua trigrams of yin and yang trigrams by setting up a nine-cubic grid composed of nine neutral cubes. And trigrams and text hints are placed nearby for players to reference. When the player get correct the trigram by hitting cubes with energy blocks, the puzzle is successfully solved.
                    <b>Players After discovering that energy blocks can also be used to solve puzzles, players will gain a certain sense of surprise and learn the trigram puzzle solving mechanism.</b>

                Referring to Nintendo's idea of designing the levels to be "起承转合", the third level mainly plays the role of "twist" and "thrown away". It is a challenge to test the player's mastery of the first two levels. In order to keep the player in a "flow", the introduction of new mechanisms with minor modifications, to a certain extent, to enhance the difficulty of the game.
            </p>
            <ol style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Method:</b>
                <li><b>In order to give players a small increase in the difficulty of the game on the basis of the previous one, keeping in the " flow " channel,</b>the Attributes Switching Cannon is introduced。Players have already understood and mastered the mechanism of the cannon and the method of defeating the cannon in the second level, so in the third level the method of switching the attributes of the cannon has slightly increased the difficulty of the combat based on the existing one, players need to do some thinking, but can master the new mechanism easily.</li>
                <li><b>In order to give players a better sense of challenge, surprise and achievement, </b>This level refers to the concept of "twist", the first two levels of the machine obstacles are placed in the level, and more closely, to improve the difficulty of a certain degree.<b>同时为了符合“阴阳交错”的主题,</b>At the same time, in order to comply with the theme of " Intersection of Yin and Yang", this level of different yin and yang attributes of the mechanism / obstacles are placed more frequently, and the ambient lighting also made the corresponding staggered arrangement.</li>
                <li><b>To pave the way for the final puzzle and give the player hints,</b>a yin attribute trigram puzzle is set up in the middle of the level. <b>This also examines the player's ability to observe and think</b>，In the distance there is a kan - water trigram hint, if the player can observe, with a previous level of the kan trigram experience, can know that the current need to play the kan trigram.</li>
                <li><b>In order to comply with the end of the harmony of yin and yang again</b>, the final puzzle refers to the concept of "Li" representing the south and "Kan" representing the north in the Bagua, and sets the mechanism of pressing the button to move the two trigrams to the corresponding direction.The victory point portal in the third level also references this concept, with particle effects of water and fire placed above and below the yin and yang diagrams, respectively.</li>
                <li>The textual hints within the level refer to some extent to the content of ancient texts related to Bagua.</li>

                <li><b>Attracting range effects:</b>When the player presses the attract button, a semi-circular magnetic effect is generated centered on the player's character <b>to indicate the player's available attracting range.</b></li>
                <li><b>Timed flip-flop platform: </b>The platform has two sides, one yin and one yang, and is flipped every fixed time. Gives damage to the player when it is consistent with the player's character attributes. Used to increase the difficulty of the level in an attempt to solidify the player in the flow experience.</li>
                <li><b>Energy Block Chain:</b>The yin and yang energy blocks, in accordance with certain paths, are staggered to conduct energy, and if not for the yin-yang-yin-yang placement, energy will not be conducted.There are energy emitters (with yin and yang attributes) at the beginning of the path and energy receivers at the end. When the energy receiver receives energy, it opens the corresponding door or generates a platform for the player to pass through. This mechanism is used to enrich the player's level experience.</li>
                <li>When the player is in a state of attraction, the camera is shifted to facilitate the player to aim</li>
