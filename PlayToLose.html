                <span>This prototype was finished in my master course Game Design Studio week 5, a game jam project in three days.
                    The theme of Game Jam is Play to Lose,
                <br><br>
                <b>Brainstorming：</b><br>
                    <br>Sometimes when players’ intentions go against the character’s intentions,
                    they may hope to have a chance to choose to lose. Like many players' actions in the game This War of Mine. Based on this idea,
                    we thought of Erlang Shen,
                    a Chinese god who captured and imprisoned his sister because she married a mortal man (which was not allowed in the laws of gods).
                    The majority of viewers of this story hope that Erlang Shen will never catch his sister.
                    Therefore, we thought about designing a runner game based on this story, in which players could control Erlang Shen,
                    and our players could have the chance to let the sister go.

                    <br>But, since it is a Chinese myth and might cause some confusion to our players,
                    we decided to change the background story for our game, and stick to the core point that players control the villain.
                    The first version is about working for a tyrant.

                    <br>Then we came up with a more familiar background - gangsters. And our main character changed
                    from an undercover detective in a gang to a son of a gangster boss, in order to give our players more agency to choose what they want to do.

                <b>Game Description：</b>
                Who are You is a 3D, platform, runner and action game based on the core point “players control the villains and have agency to lose”.
                The story unfolds in contemporary days. A boy named X,
                who was a son of a gang boss but used to live a normal life without knowing what his father was doing,
                was forced to join the gang after the death of his father. Due to some reasons,
                he was just an enforcer team captain at the bottom of the gang chain and his main job was to catch people according
                to the orders of the current gang boss.

                <br><br></p>

            <p style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Gameplay：</b><br>
                In the game, the player needs to decide the protagonist’s behavior: catch the boss's enemies or let them go,
                to influence on 3 types of attribute values, to shape the protagonist’s characteristic.
                Different combinations of 3 types of values will lead to different game results.
                The player will always lose but will also always win at the same time.
                For example, if the player lets the boss’s enemies go, he may lose the boss's tolerance,
                and win the favor from innocent people. Thus, the player will always play to lose, but also play to win. Players need to make a trade-off.

                <br>
                There are two main parts of gameplay - Runner and Action.
                <br><br>
