                This RPG game named Ouroboros was developed in Microsoft’s university game development competitions, by me and three friends.
                The game was developed with Unreal Engine 4. Almost all art resources were from Epic’s open source art resources,
                or bought and got authorization, since we were beginners who only know programming knowledge at that time.
                I was responsible for characters’ design, part of story’s design,
                implementations of controlling of player’s character, animations binding and implementations of NPC’s behavior tree.
            </p>
            <p style="color: white;text-align: left;margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;text-indent: 2em">
                The game tells a story of a loyal general, who after being framed by an evil wizard and exile to magic prison
                with infinite loop set up by the wizard,
                still wants to escape from the prison, go back to save his country.
                Ouroboros, a circular symbol depicting a snake, or less commonly a dragon, swallowing its tail,
                as an emblem of wholeness or infinity. It represents the game’s basic design idea,
                magic infinite loop for the faithful general (players) to escape.

            <p style="color: white;text-align: left;margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;text-indent: 2em">
                The protagonist, Ouroboros, is a loyal general of the king and loves poetry. He has a mysterious diary that has been passed down in his family for several generations (it records the works of his predecessors, so he treasures them), but he does not know that it contains a powerful force that can change the world (seal, time back and etc., inherited by blood).
            </p>
            <p style="color: white;text-align: left;margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;text-indent: 2em">
                Villain Der Tod, the devil that was suppressed by the diary one thousand years ago, he escapes when the seal loosens, and he still not recover strength completely yet. The devil covets the power of diary all the time, but has a fear (he does not know the full power of diary and how to utilize the diary).
            </p>
            <p style="color: white;text-align: left;margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;text-indent: 2em">
                Ten years ago, Der Tod through prophecy presumably speculated about the location of the diary, then incarnated as a human, changed his name, into the human kingdom, with the devil's natural skill to play with the heart, he quickly climbed to a man under the position of the high priest, and with the help of his forces to find the diary. One night, Ouroboros stumbled upon the fact that Der Tod's men had killed civilians. Der Tod wanted to "dispose" the Ouroboros as usual, but was surprised to find that the diary seems to be carried by Ouroboros, so he fakes a crime and sends Ouroboros to a "inverted image" castle on the northern border (an alien space that completely copies the original local scene) in an attempt to understand the diary and keep it for himself…
