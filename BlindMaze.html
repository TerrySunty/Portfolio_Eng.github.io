                <span>This prototype was finished in my master course Game Design Studio week 3, a game jam project in three days.
                    The theme of Game Jam is Communication,
                    We were required to design the mechanism with both verbal and nonverbal method for players to do communication.
                <br>
                Brainstorming：Inspired by my friend's idea, which is about let people build their own communication system, the idea which let players build their own communication system
                    came up with in my mind.
                    Players can send a signal as instruction for the teammate to move towards correct direction, cooperate with each other to get rid of the maze. <br></span></p>

            <p style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Game description：</b>This is a two-player（may be three-player in the future）round based online cooperation puzzle game. The devil puts the two innocent players
                into a prepared maze, tease them.
                Players have to utilize their characters' own communication ability to cooperation, build their own communication system, and meet at the center of the maze to flee away from the maze.
                <br><br></p>
            <p style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Gameplay：</b>At the beginning of the game, each player has 4 nonverbal stamps and 2 verbal stamps.
                Each player can see the teammate's side map in realtime. Which means player A can see the half map of the maze where Player B is located.
                Stamps of two players are the same.
                At the beginning, 4 nonverbal stamps don't have any meaning, It requires two players to gradually determine the meaning of each stamp (forward/backward/left/right)
                by sending stamps to each other through trial and error.
                Two verbal stamps (correct/false) reduce the difficulty of the game to a certain extent,
                Players can help build a communication system by observing the actions of another player on the map and sending feedback.
                <br><br>
                <b>Specific Mechanism:</b>
                <ol style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <li>Each game has a limit on the number of rounds/duration.
                    Within the limited number of rounds/duration, if both players do not reach the center of the maze, the game will fail.</li>
                <li>At the start of the game, the pictures of the 4 non-verbal stamps will be randomly assigned.</li>
                <li>At the beginning of each round, player A sends a non-verbal badge to player B, player B takes action after receiving the signal, player
                    A sends a feedback stamp signal according to the half-real-time map where player B is,
                    and player A ends the round. Player B then repeats player A's actions.</li>
                <li>After the player taps the stamp to send the signal, the corresponding image will appear in the center of the other player's screen.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p style="color: white; text-align: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px">
                <b>Design purpose：I want to give players a warm experience of cooperating with strangers in unfamiliar environments,
                    constantly trying and making mistakes, going through many difficulties,
                    and finally meeting in one place and escaping from the maze.
                    At the same time, it also achieves the purpose of Emergent Gameplay to a certain extent.</b>
